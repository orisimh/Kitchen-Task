# Kitchen-Task

given a building floor map , the goal of this project is to find empty space location to put a kitchen in , which the sum of distances to all employees is minimal.

W - wall
E - employee
[SPACE] - empty space

The distance from an empty space to an employee is the shortest path from the employee to the empty space.
Employees can only walk in north, south, east or west directions (no diagonals).
Employees cannot walk through walls (of course).

The Solution was implemented by BFS Algorithm in Python Language.
